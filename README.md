# Digital_Forensics_And_Digital_Investigation_Workshop

## üìå Introduction
This project demonstrates **digital forensic investigation** using the open-source tool [Autopsy](https://www.autopsy.com/).  
Autopsy helps forensic analysts recover, analyze, and report on evidence from digital devices such as hard drives, SSDs, and mobile devices.

## üéØ Objectives
- Perform forensic investigation using **Autopsy software**  
- Recover deleted files and hidden artifacts  
- Analyze **browser history, emails, and metadata**  
- Generate forensic reports for legal or organizational use

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
- **Software**  
  - Autopsy Digital Forensics Tool  
  - Sleuth Kit (comes with Autopsy)  
- **System**  
  - OS: Windows / Linux / macOS  
  - RAM: 4 GB minimum (8 GB recommended)  
  - CPU: 2 GHz or higher

## üöÄ Setup & Usage
1. Download and install [Autopsy](https://www.autopsy.com/download/).  
2. Launch Autopsy and **create a new case**.  
3. **Add a data source** (disk image, local drive, or directory).  
4. Select ingest modules (keyword search, hash lookup, file type detection, etc.).  
5. Analyze evidence:  
   - Deleted/recovered files  
   - Internet browsing artifacts  
   - Emails, documents, and images  
   - Metadata (EXIF, timestamps)  
6. Generate and export a **forensic report** (HTML, CSV, PDF).

## üìÇ Example Use Case
**Scenario**:  
A suspect‚Äôs laptop image is analyzed to check for:  
- Deleted confidential files  
- Suspicious browsing activities  
- Metadata linking files to the suspect  

**Autopsy Findings**:  
- Recovery of deleted documents  
- Browser history analysis  
- Timeline correlation of user activity  

---

## ‚ö° Features
- File system analysis (NTFS, FAT, EXT, HFS+, APFS)  
- Deleted file recovery  
- Browser artifact analysis  
- Timeline of user activities  
- Metadata extraction (EXIF from images)  
- Report generation (HTML, Excel, PDF)  

---

## üö® Challenges
- Large data volumes ‚Üí longer analysis time  
- Encrypted/password-protected files  
- Volatile data loss (RAM not captured)  
- Legal & privacy concerns
